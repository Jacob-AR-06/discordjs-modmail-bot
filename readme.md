> The only modmail-bot you need to improve communication in your discord server. Easy to use, requires little permissions, database usage (ticket store) and customisable

## Install

```sh
yarn install / npm install
```

Install all needed dependencies in order to work.

## Setup

❗ **permissions**

The best option is go give the bot `Administrator` permissions, but you can do it the hard way and only give the permissions it needs. Required permissions:

- Read & Send Messages ~ (obivously) If the bot isn't able to read messages or send messages, it doesn't respond to your requests.
- Manage Channels ~ (required) This is needed so the bot is able to create / edit / delete channels.
- Embed Links & Message Attachments ~ (required) Without the bot isn't able to send 9/10 messages.
- Add Reactiona ~ (required) This is needed to show that the ticket owner has received the reply and to be able to setup the ticket claim system.

**Starting the bot**

It's a really simple process, first you need to rename the `.env.example` to `.env`. After that fill in the gaps!

This is what you should fill in:

```
TOKEN= <discord bot token>
DB= <mongodb url>

WB_ID= <webhook id> -> used to log errors, check the config.json file to turn it off or on!
WB_TOKEN= <webhook token> -> used to log errors, check the config.json file to turn it off or on!

PREFIX= <prefix>
```

Do **not** add any spaces, everything should be connected to each other. Otherwise you will get an error.
Do the same for the `config.json.example` file, rename it to `config.json.example`. Once you done that....
